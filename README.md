## :ghost: Here,you will see a soul.​

Hi,here is Wendao Lee,a nobody. I'm majoring in  **Geographic Information Science** 🎉,but also costs much on **Computer Science**. 

I always do some useless work  just out of interest,for which you can view through my repositories. Do hope the things I have done could help someone in the future days —— Err......absurd wishes.

> Desperate.
